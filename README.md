Medical Tourism Payments
Description
The Medical Tourism Payments smart contract is a blockchain-based solution built on the Aptos network that facilitates secure, transparent, and efficient payment processing for medical tourism services. This decentralized application enables patients seeking medical treatment abroad to make payments directly to healthcare providers, medical facilitators, and related service providers through smart contracts, ensuring trust and reducing intermediary costs.
The contract leverages the Move programming language to create a robust payment infrastructure that can handle various aspects of medical tourism transactions, including:

Secure escrow services for treatment payments
Multi-party payment distribution to healthcare providers, hospitals, and facilitators
Transparent fee structures and payment tracking
Automated payment release based on treatment milestones
Cross-border payment facilitation without traditional banking intermediaries
